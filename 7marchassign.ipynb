    "1. Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. It is also known as the average. The mean is sensitive to outliers since it takes into account every value in the dataset. It is commonly used when the data is normally distributed or when we want to find the average value of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency. It is often used when the dataset contains outliers or when the data is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it is the value with the highest frequency. A dataset can have multiple modes (multimodal) or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data, such as colors or categories, rather than continuous numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures are used to understand the central tendency of a dataset in different scenarios. The mean provides an overall average of the data, while the median gives a measure of the central value that is less influenced by outliers. The mode identifies the most common value(s) in the dataset."

It provides a rough estimate of how spread out the data points are. However, the range only considers the extreme values and does not account for the distribution of values in between.\n",

Variance considers all the data points and provides a more comprehensive measure of dispersion. However, since it involves squared differences, the variance is not in the same unit as the original data, making it less interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average amount of deviation or dispersion from the mean. The standard deviation is often preferred over variance as it is in the same unit as the original data and is more easily interpretable. It provides a measure of the spread of the dataset around the mean.\n",

Then, we calculate the squared differences between each value and the mean, and find their average: [(20 - 21.14)^2 + (22 - 21.14)^2 + ... + (18 - 21.14)^2] / 7 ≈ 4.67. The variance indicates the average squared deviation from the mean temperature.\n",

    "Covariance and correlation are both measures used to quantify the relationship between variables in statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance:\n",
    "- Covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together. It indicates the direction (positive or negative) and the magnitude of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "- Covariance can take any value, positive or negative, depending on the nature of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "- The magnitude of covariance is not standardized, making it difficult to compare across different datasets or variables.\n",
    "- Covariance is affected by the units of measurement of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation:\n",
    "- Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a standardized version of covariance.\n",
    "- Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "- Correlation is unitless, making it easier to compare across different datasets or variables.\n",
    "- Correlation is a more useful measure when comparing variables with different scales or units.\n",
    "- Correlation is a more popular and widely used measure compared to covariance due to its standardized nature."

    "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. Here's how outliers affect these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "1. Mean: Outliers can significantly affect the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total count, outliers with extreme values can pull the mean towards them. This can result in a skewed estimation of the central value if the outliers are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is generally more robust to outliers compared to the mean. Outliers have less influence on the median because it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. However, if an outlier is extreme enough, it can still affect the median, particularly if the dataset is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: Outliers typically do not affect the mode since it represents the most frequent value(s) in the dataset. Outliers tend to be distinct and not recurring, so they do not impact the mode directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "1. Range: Outliers can significantly impact the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. If an outlier has an extremely high or low value, it can cause the range to increase dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers have a substantial effect on the variance and standard deviation. Both measures rely on the squared deviations from the mean. Outliers with extreme values can increase the deviations, leading to larger variances and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate the impact of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 300]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the value 300 is an outlier. Let's see how it affects the measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: The presence of the outlier 300 significantly influences the mean. The mean would be pulled towards the outlier, resulting in a higher value than what represents the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Median: The median is less affected by the outlier. It remains close to the center of the dataset, reflecting the typical value of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: The outlier increases the range of the dataset, as the difference between the maximum value (300) and minimum value (10) becomes larger due to the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance and Standard Deviation: The outlier affects both variance and standard deviation by increasing the dispersion. The squared deviations from the mean, which are summed in variance and used in calculating the standard deviation, are influenced by the outlier's large value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, outliers can distort measures of central tendency, such as the mean, and impact measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation. It is crucial to identify and handle outliers appropriately to obtain accurate and meaningful statistical summaries."
